# Blackwell-Wattage-Performance

Interactive 3D visualization of vLLM benchmarks across multiple wattage configurations on 2× RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs.

### Features
- **3D Heatmap**: Compare throughput across concurrency and context length.
- **Wiggle Stereoscopy**: Enhanced depth perception via subtle camera oscillation.
- **Slicing**: Analyze cross-sections by user count, context length, or target throughput.
- **Interactive Toggles**: Show/hide specific power limits (200W–600W).
